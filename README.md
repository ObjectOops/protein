# protein
A **really old** Jupyter Notebook that was used for protein translating.

___

This notebook was created in Google Colab to automate the translation of DNA into its protein sequence.  
Unfortunately, today I cannot say how exactly said automation works.  
While there are numerous flaws with the program (e.g. ineffeciency and boolean comparisons in conditionals), it has utility as educational and reference material, which is why it is now here.
